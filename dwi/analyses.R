# Code to perform analyses for the study
# 

# 1) load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(lme4)
library(lmerTest)
library(janitor)

# 2) read in your two CSVs

  rename(sub_id = `sub-id`)

  clean_names()  
# now you should have: sub_id, hemi, ses_01, ses_02, ses_03

# then pivot:
imaging_long <- result %>%
  pivot_longer(

# 7) Join imaging and clinical data
df_long <- imaging_long %>%

df_long <- df_long %>%
  group_by(sub_id) %>%
  # age is constant within each subject so group_mean = age itself;

  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(
    age_c = AGE - mean(AGE, na.rm=TRUE)

# treat age and sex as fixed effects
m_cov <- lmer(

                 + age_c          # between-subject
                 + SEX          # between-subject
